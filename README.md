### Question 3: Comparison of Nigeria’s profitability in 2014 to other African countries and exploration of potential factors impacting performance.
•	Nigeria: -$23,285.19 (Loss)
•	Some profitable African Countries i:
o	Algeria: $3,429.18
o	Egypt: $6,493.05
o	Ghana: $2,775.06
o	Kenya: $1,238.07
o	Morocco: $8,444.43
o	South Africa: $9,363.24
o	Tunisia: $51.06
**Nigeria had a significant loss compared to other African countries, all of which showed positive profits.**

### Factors Affecting Nigeria’s Performance
•	Nigeria's Average Shipping Cost: $5.50
•	Other African Countries' Average Shipping Cost: $18.28
•	Nigeria's Average Discount: 70.00%
•	Other African Countries' Average Discount: 0.00%
**Analysis**
•	Shipping Costs: Nigeria has a significantly lower average shipping cost compared to other African countries. Therefore, high shipping costs are not a contributing factor to Nigeria's poor performance.
•	Discounts: Nigeria along with the other 2 countries  has an extremely high average discount of 70%, while other African countries have no discounts on average. This high discount rate could be a major factor contributing to the negative profitability in Nigeria.


### Question 4: Identification of the least profitable product subcategory in Southeast Asia and recommendations on whether to continue offering these products in specific countries.
-the least  Profitable Product Subcategory in Southeast Asia
•	Subcategory: Tables
•	Total Profit: -$18,618.31 (Loss)
**Specific Country in Southeast Asia to Stop Offering Tables**
•	Indonesia shows the most significant loss, with about -$10,680.28 
•	Other countries like Thailand, the Philippines, and Myanmar also show substantial losses.
Given these results, Indonesia appears to be a specific country in Southeast Asia where Global Superstore should consider stopping the offering of the "Tables" subcategory due to its significant unprofitability as well as Thailand, the Philippines and Myanmar.

The least profitable city in the United States, considering cities with at least 10 orders, is Lancaster. The average profit here is approximately -$157.37.

•-High average discount: The mean discount offered in Lancaster is about 31.52%, which is relatively high and could be cutting into potential profits.
-Shipping costs: The average shipping cost in Lancaster is $23.99, which might not be adequately offset by sales revenue, impacting overall profitability

## Additional Insight
### Trends
-Sales and profits show a clear seasonal patten, peaking during November and December due to holiday shopping. There's noticeable growth year-over-year, with a significant spike in the last year, possibly driven by an expansion in new markets.

### Geographic Performance
-The United States and Europe are the top-performing regions in terms of sales and profits. However, performance in Southeast Asia is mixed, with countries like Singapore showing strong sales but countries like Indonesia not as profitable, possibly due to high operational costs or discounts.

### Product Performance
-Technology and Office Supplies are the top-selling categories. Within Technology, laptops and mobile phones are particularly profitable. However, tables within the Furniture category show negative profitability, indicating potential issues with product pricing or supplier costs.

### Customer Segmentation
-High-value customers typically purchase technology and high-end office supplies. These customers are characterized by fewer, but larger transactions. Middle-tier customers frequently buy office supplies in bulk, suggesting they might be small businesses.

### Discounts
-Moderate discounts (10-20%) increase sales volumes without substantially hurting profits, but deeper discounts (above 30%) significantly reduce profit margins. There's a notable threshold where discounts start diminishing returns on profitability.
